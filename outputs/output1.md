PROJECTS
* Vasculature segmentation in 3D scans of Human Kidney
    * Developed a model for segmenting vasculature in 3D scans of human kidneys using CT images acquired with Hip-CT technology.
    * Performed data augmentation using the Albumentations library.
    * Implemented the segmentation model using the Attention U-Net architecture in PyTorch.
    * Improved the accuracy and efficiency of kidney vasculature segmentation in medical imaging.
* Prompt Recovery using Gemma
    * Addressed the challenge of retrieving specific prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating rephrased text.
    * Utilized a dataset containing original texts and their rephrased versions from Gemma.
    * Used Hugging Face's transformers library and applied techniques like quantization and LoRA to fine-tune Gemma-7b model by Google for precise prompt recovery.
