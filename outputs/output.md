The user possesses a strong background in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP, demonstrating proficiency in relevant frameworks and libraries. However, transitioning to a Full Stack Developer role at Amazon requires a different skill set focused on web development technologies. Here's a breakdown of the gaps and a roadmap for acquiring the necessary skills:

**Skill Gaps:**

1. **Front-End Development:**  Lack of experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js is a significant gap.  These are fundamental for building user interfaces and interactive web applications.

2. **Back-End Development:** Limited exposure to server-side languages like Java, Python (for web frameworks like Django/Flask), or Node.js. Understanding of RESTful APIs and building backend logic is crucial.

3. **Databases:**  Experience with SQL and NoSQL databases is essential.  Familiarity with database design, querying, and management is needed for handling data in web applications.

4. **Cloud Platforms (AWS):**  Practical experience with AWS services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and RDS is highly desirable for deploying and managing web applications on the cloud.

5. **Web Development Frameworks:** While the user has experience with ML/AI frameworks, they need to learn web frameworks like Spring Boot (Java), Django/Flask (Python), or Express.js (Node.js).

6. **Version Control (Git):** Proficiency with Git for code management and collaboration is crucial in a software development environment.

7. **Testing and Debugging:**  Experience with writing unit and integration tests and debugging web applications is necessary for ensuring code quality.



**Actionable Steps and Tech Stack to Learn (with approximate learning time):**

1. **Front-End Development (8-12 weeks):**
    * **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Fundamentals (4 weeks):** Start with online courses and interactive tutorials (freeCodeCamp, Codecademy).  Build small projects to practice.
    * **Choose a JavaScript Framework (4-8 weeks):** React, Angular, or Vue.js. Focus on one framework and build progressively complex projects. Consider online courses or bootcamps for structured learning.

2. **Back-End Development (8-12 weeks):**
    * **Choose a Language and Framework (4-8 weeks):**  Java with Spring Boot, Python with Django/Flask, or Node.js with Express.js.  Learn the basics of the language and then delve into the chosen framework.
    * **RESTful APIs (2 weeks):** Understand how to design and build RESTful APIs using the chosen framework.

3. **Databases (4-6 weeks):**
    * **SQL (2-3 weeks):** Learn SQL syntax, database design principles, and practice querying using MySQL or PostgreSQL.
    * **NoSQL (2-3 weeks):** Explore NoSQL databases like MongoDB or DynamoDB. Understand the different types of NoSQL databases and when to use them.

4. **Cloud Platforms (AWS) (4-6 weeks):**
    * **AWS Free Tier:** Start with the AWS Free Tier to explore various services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and RDS.
    * **AWS Certifications:** Consider pursuing AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner or AWS Certified Developer â€“ Associate certifications for demonstrating cloud proficiency.

5. **Version Control (Git) (1-2 weeks):**
    * **Online Tutorials:** Learn Git basics through online tutorials and practice using platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

6. **Testing and Debugging (2-4 weeks):**  Learn testing frameworks associated with your chosen backend framework and practice writing unit and integration tests.


**Interesting and Relevant Findings:**

* **Demand for Full-Stack Developers:**  Full-stack developers remain in high demand in 2024, especially those proficient in cloud technologies and modern JavaScript frameworks.
* **Focus on AWS:**  Amazon heavily utilizes AWS, making AWS experience a significant advantage for aspiring full-stack developers at the company.
* **Importance of System Design:**  For senior roles, understanding system design principles and architectural patterns is becoming increasingly important.

By addressing these skill gaps and dedicating time to learning, the user can significantly improve their chances of landing a Full Stack Developer role at Amazon. Remember to build projects to demonstrate practical skills and tailor your resume and cover letter to highlight the newly acquired skills.
